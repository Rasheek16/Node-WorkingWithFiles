# Node-WorkingWithFiles

This repository contains Node.js code examples demonstrating various file and directory operations. The code is organized into three main folders:

## 1. DirectoryOp

The `DirectoryOp` folder includes code that performs various directory operations. It demonstrates functionalities like listing directory contents, changing the current working directory, creating files and directories, removing files and directories, renaming files, and more.

## 2. Reading

The `Reading` folder is further divided into three subfolders:

### a. Promise-Based-API

The `Promise-Based-API` folder showcases code examples utilizing Promise-based APIs for reading files. It demonstrates efficient and asynchronous file reading techniques using Node.js Promises.

### b. using-fs

The `using-fs` folder contains examples that use the built-in 'fs' module for reading files. It demonstrates different methods for file reading and handling.

### c. Using-readFile

The `Using-readFile` folder provides a simple implementation of using 'fs.stat' and 'fs.access' to gather information about files and check file accessibility.

## 3. Writing

The `Writing` folder includes a code example named `EventLogger`. This code demonstrates writing logs and showcases an event-driven approach for handling and logging events.

Feel free to explore each folder for in-depth examples and insights into working with files and directories in Node.js. Remember to install the necessary dependencies before running the code, and refer to each folder's README or comments for specific instructions if required.
